## About the Project  
This repository contains our submission for the **2025 Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence Hackathon** hosted by **ČVUT, Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering (FJFI)** in **Děčín, Czechia**.  

Our team **nullbyte** represents **Střední škola AGC a.s.**  
We came together to explore, experiment, and push the limits of machine learning — all within just 22 hours.  

The hackathon challenges teams of high school students to create innovative AI or ML-based solutions for real-world problems, combining technical skill, creativity, and teamwork.
